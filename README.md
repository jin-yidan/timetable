# Timetable (Minimal Timeline Widget)

An offline, minimalist timeline you can open in a browser.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it).
- Your events persist in the browser via `localStorage`.

## Features

- Add / edit / delete events (time, event, footnote)
- Vertical timeline presentation
- Mark events as **Important** (★), and filter via tabs: **All** / **Important**
- Mark events as **Done** (○ → ✓) to dim + strike completed items
- Flexible time entry: type `1735`, `5:35`, `5pm`, etc. (auto-normalizes to `HH:MM`)
- Quick time chips: **Now**, **+30m**, **+1h**
- Event suggestions from past events (via input autocomplete)

## Tips (make it feel like a “home page widget”)

- **Set as browser home page / new tab**: Most browsers let you set a custom page; point it to your local `index.html`.
- **Keep it always around**: Pin the tab, or create a shortcut that opens this file.
